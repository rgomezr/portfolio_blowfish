## Who am I? üëÄ

Hey there! You don't arrive here by mistake, so, welcome!

I'm 27 years old and I currently live in D√ºsseldorf (Germany) - If you're wondering how integrated I already am, let's talk about it while we wait for the DB Train üöá

Previously, I've lived in the beautiful Emerald Isle üáÆüá™ for 2 years, and in my hometown, C√°ceres (Spain) for most of my life. If you've watched Game Of Thrones (GOT), you probably know more from C√°ceres than what you might think - Its old town became the King's Landing in the seventh season üè∞

Always heedful to embrace challenges as opportunities to learn and thrive. I understand the need of others and can communicate ideas, information and emotions, clearly.

Driven by a strong interest in developing and optimising server-side functionality and an enthusiasm for Data and System Architecture - What can we not build? Let's build it together üî®

Multifaceted within many hobbies, being specialty coffee making, the main one at present - If you like to enjoy a special cup of coffee, full of interesting aromas and flavours, you'll appreciate having me around!

I'd like to conclude this section with the below quote, as it emphasises my belief in perseverance and that growth, is **always** possible.
> _Challenges are what make life interesting. Overcoming them makes life meaningful - Joshua J.Marine_
