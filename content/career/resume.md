## Who am I? 👀

Hey there! I’m 26 years old and I live in a small town close to Düsseldorf, Germany.

Previously I’ve lived in Ireland for 2 years and in my hometown, Cáceres (Spain) for most of my life.

I'm a growth minded person, who believes in the importance of social relationships. I’m emphatic accurate and an effective communicator.

I’m passionate about technology and software engineering, especially system architecture design, backend development and DevOps.

Multifaceted within many hobbies, being specialty coffee making, the main one at present.
